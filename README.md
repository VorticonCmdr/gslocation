# gs location changer

This is the code repository for the Chrome extension [gs location changer](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/gs-location-changer/blpgcfdpnimjdojecbpagkllfnkajglp). With the help of this extension you can change your location within Google Search by setting the x-geo http header.

Once you set a location Google will write a cookie UULE which also contains the location which is set via the x-geo http header. Therefor to clear the location this extension also will delete the UULE cookie in order to reset all changes made.
